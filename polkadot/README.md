# Polkadot

NeuroWeb, formerly known as OriginTrail Parachain, operates as a parachain on the Polkadot network. Polkadot serves as the relay chain, providing shared security and interoperability among various connected chains, including NeuroWeb.

In this relationship, Polkadot's relay chain ensures the security of NeuroWeb by incorporating it into the broader Polkadot network's consensus mechanism. This shared security model enhances the resilience and integrity of NeuroWeb's operations.

Moreover, Polkadot's design facilitates interoperability by allowing different parachains, like NeuroWeb, to communicate and share information across the Polkadot network. This interoperability ensures a seamless flow of data and assets between different blockchains connected to the Polkadot ecosystem.

In essence, NeuroWeb benefits from the shared security provided by Polkadot's relay chain and gains interoperability with other chains within the Polkadot network, fostering a more connected and robust decentralized ecosystem.
