<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/NeuroWeb X visual (1).jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

NeuroWeb Network is a decentralized artificial intelligence (AI) blockchain designed to incentivize knowledge creation, connectivity, and sharing through **Knowledge Mining**. Its utility token NEURO is designed to fuel the AI knowledge economy, rewarding relevant knowledge contributions to the **OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph**.&#x20;

NeuroWeb builds on the basis of its predecessor - the OriginTrail Parachain - which was transformed into NeuroWeb via a community Governance vote on OriginTrail Parachain in December 2023.\
\
NeuroWeb is a permissionless, EVM-enabled blockchain secured by Polkadot validators.
