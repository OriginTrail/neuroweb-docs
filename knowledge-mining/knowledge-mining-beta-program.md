# Knowledge mining beta program

The genesis beta program is intended to bootstrap knowledge mining capabilities through an iterative process of crowdsourcing knowledge, harnessing high quality knowledge for artificial intelligence (AI) through NeuroWeb blockchain and NEURO token. During the beta knowledge mining program, an initial **1.000.000 NEURO** token pool will be made available for miners contributing knowledge in selected categories.

The program focuses on 5 categories of Knowledge:

* Art
* DeSci
* OriginTrail & Web3 Ecosystems
* Construction & Sustainability
* Fintech knowledge

### Art Knowledge Mining (live now)

Compete for your part of the **200.000 NEURO** rewards pool among the vibrant community of artists that are adding their creations to the OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph as the first group of Knowledge miners.

Apply for knowledge mining. Get whitelisted to mint your art using ChatDKG on X. Inspire generative creation from your artwork. Claim your NEURO rewards.

How are NEURO rewards calculated and distributed?

Rewards will be distributed every 2 weeks from the launch of the art category. Every 2 weeks all published knowledge assets in the category will be assessed according to connections pointing to your art (e.g. from generative art created from your Knowledge Assets).
