# Knowledge mining beta program

The Knowledge mining beta program is intended to kick-start knowledge mining capabilities through an iterative process of **crowdsourcing knowledge** for decentralized artificial intelligence (AI) through NeuroWeb blockchain and NEURO token. During the beta knowledge mining program, a token pool of **1,000,000 NEURO** will be made available for miners contributing knowledge in selected categories (each category will receive 20% of the total token pool).

The knowledge mining beta program aims to feed learnings on the various approaches to incentivising knowledge mining via the NeuroWeb blockchain, ultimately implementing knowledge mining capabilities in production.

The beta program focuses on 5 categories:

* Art
* Decentralized Science (DeSci)
* OriginTrail & Web3 Ecosystems
* Construction & Sustainability
* Fintech knowledge

## Art Knowledge Mining (live now)

Compete for your part of the **200,000 NEURO** rewards pool among the vibrant community of artists that are adding their creations to the OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph as the first group of Knowledge miners.

To get started with Art knowledge mining, apply for the Knowledge Mining beta program on [neuroweb.ai](https://neuroweb.ai/). Once your application is approved you will be eligible for beta knowledge mining via X.

### Art Knowledge Mining via X

To get started with knowledge mining for art on X you can utilize the @ChatDKG X bot.\
\
To mine knowledge you can use the following commands:

* _**/mint**_ command, which creates a new [knowledge asset](https://docs.origintrail.io/decentralized-knowledge-graph-layer-2/dkg-basic-concepts#what-is-a-knowledge-asset) from an existing image
* _**/imagine**_ command, which creates a derivative art piece and corresponding knowledge asset from a provided art knowledge asset, with an appropriate connection in the DKG

To use the /mint command, simply tweet:

<pre data-overflow="wrap"><code><strong>/mint @ChatDKG [Artwork Name] | [Description] | [Artform] | [Author Name] | [Image URL]
</strong></code></pre>

To use the /imagine command, simply tweet:

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```
/imagine @ChatDKG [UAL of original artwork] | [Prompt for the new image] | [New artwork name] | [New artwork Description] | [Author Name]
```
{% endcode %}

## **How are NEURO rewards calculated and distributed?**

Rewards will be distributed every 2 weeks from the launch of the Art category. There will be a total of **four 2-week periods** in which rewards will be distributed, each period amounting to **50,000 NEURO** in total rewards.&#x20;

Every 2 weeks all published Knowledge Assets in the category will be assessed according to number of knowledge assets created by a knowledge miner and number of connections pointing to each art (e.g. from generative art created from your Knowledge Assets). The Knowledge Assets from previous periods are always accumulating for ranking in each of the next periods.&#x20;

{% hint style="success" %}
Important: The Knowledge Assets created with ChatDKG on X prior to the launch of Knowledge Mining will also count towards the ranking for its publisher. &#x20;
{% endhint %}

Based on that, a ranking list of Knowledge miners will be created. The rewards will be distributed among the top 25 contributors as follows:

1 - 10,000 NEURO

2 - 5,000 NEURO

3 - 5,000 NEURO

4 to 10 - 2,500 NEURO

11 to 20 - 1,000 NEURO

20 to 25 - 500 NEURO

Additional categories will be open for knowledge mining in the coming weeks, including the accompanying knowledge mining kit
