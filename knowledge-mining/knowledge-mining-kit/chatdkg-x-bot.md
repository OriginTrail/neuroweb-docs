# ChatDKG - X bot

Discover the power of decentralized knowledge mining with the ChatDKG X Bot! Hereâ€™s a quick guide to get you started.

To mine knowledge, use the `/mine` command. This command allows you to extract valuable information from websites and add it to the DKG and NeuroWeb.

Create a post on X with following content:

```
/mine @ChatDKG <Website URL> | <User EVM Wallet> | <Paranet Name>
```

#### Parameters

* **Website URL**: The URL of the website whose content you want to mine knowledge
* **EVM User Wallet**: Your EVM wallet address that you will use to claim knowledge mining rewards
* **Paranet Name (optional)**: The name of the paranet where you want to add the mined knowledge. Currently, only the **Polkabot** paranet is supported, with more to come soon

#### Example

```
/mine @ChatDKG https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-async-backing | 0x19bE11Eb85795B68D141b04C729910455f520546 | Polkabot
