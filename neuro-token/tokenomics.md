# Tokenomics

The total supply of NEURO that will ever be created is limited to 1,000,000,000 tokens. However, out of the maximum amount of tokens, only half was initially allocated, whilst the remaining half is minted through inflation in perpetuity, asymptotically reaching a 1,000,000,000 NEURO maximum supply.

The total allocation among different pools taking into account both the genesis release and the inflationary release is as follows:&#x20;

* Collators incentives - 22%
* Auction rewards - 34.5%
* DKG paranets incentivization (Knowledge mining) pool - 22%
* Treasury - 12.5%&#x20;
* Community treasury - 6.5%&#x20;
* Genesis community distribution - 2.5%
