# Roadmap

NeuroWeb Network is a decentralized Artificial Intelligence blockchain designed to incentivise knowledge creation, connectivity and sharing through Knowledge Mining. It's utility token NEURO is designed to fuel the AI knowledge economy, rewarding relevant knowledge contributions to the OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph.
