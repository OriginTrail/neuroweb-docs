# Roadmap

NeuroWeb Network is a decentralized artificial intelligence (AI) blockchain designed to incentivize knowledge creation, connectivity, and sharing through knowledge mining. Its utility token, NEURO, is designed to fuel the AI knowledge economy, rewarding relevant knowledge contributions to the OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG).
